# CMMI v1.3 Maturity Level 2 (L2)

The [CMMI-DEV v1.3 Technical Report](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/10tr033.cfm) was released on November 2010 by the [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.cmu.edu) of the [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu). The scope of this description covers only up to the maturity level 2 (L2).

## Process Areas

The CMMI-DEV specification describes 7 Process Areas (PA) that support the maturity level 2 (L2). The PAs that are covered by this folder structure and templates are (in english alphabetically order):

* Configuration Management (CM)
* Measurement and Analysis (MA)
* Project Monitoring and Control (PMC)
* Project Planning (PP)
* Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA)
* Requirements Management (REQM)
* Supplier Agreement Managemnt (SAM)

The PAs will be described shortly. This information was taken as-is from the [CMMI-DEV v1.3 Quick Reference](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/tools/cmmiv1-3/upload/CMMI-DEV_Quick_Ref.pdf).

### Goals and Practices

There are two categories of Goals and Practices: Generic and Specific. Specific Goals (SG) and Practices (SP) are specific to a Process Area. Generic Goals (GG) and Practices (GP) are a part of every PA. A Process Area is satisfied when organizational processes cover all of the Generic and Specific Goals and Practices for that PA.

#### Generic Goals and Practices

#### Specific Goals and Practices

Each Process Area is defined by a set of Goals and Practices. These Goals and Practices appear only in that PA.

### Project Monitoring and Control (PMC)

The purpose of Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) is to provide an understanding of the project’s progress so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken when the project’s performance deviates significantly from the plan.

* SP 1.5 - Monitor stakeholder involvement against the project plan.
* SP 1.6 - Periodically review the project’s progress, performance, and issues.
* SP 1.7 - Review the project’s accomplishments and results at selected project milestones.

#### SG 2 - Corrective actions are managed to closure when the project’s performance or results deviate significantly from the plan.

* SP 2.1 - Collect and analyze issues and determine corrective actions to address them.
* SP 2.2 - Take corrective action on identified issues.
* SP 2.3 - Manage corrective actions to closure.
